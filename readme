# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It processes a dataset of movies and their associated metadata to recommend similar movies based on user input. The system extracts relevant features and computes similarity scores to suggest movies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains movie details such as budget, genres, title, overview, etc.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains information about the cast and crew of the movies.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Extraction of genres, keywords, cast, and crew
- Implementation of a bag-of-words model for text data
- Calculation of cosine similarity to find similar movies
- Recommendation of top 5 similar movies based on user input

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn
   ```

3. Download the NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MRS.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and build the recommendation model.

3. Use the `recommend(movie)` function to get recommendations for a specific movie:
   ```python
   recommend('Avatar')
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that the dataset files are in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
- The project includes comments and explanations for each step to facilitate understanding.
